      <description>Machine Learning is the subfield of the artificial interlligence that give computers the ability to learn without being explicityly programmed.1
The main types of machine learning are supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
Supervised Learning Supervised Learning learns from being given “right answers” has been used most widely in real-world applications including spam filtering, speech recoginition, machine translation, online adversising, self-driving cars and visual inspection. The two major algorithms in supervised learning are regression and classification.</description>
