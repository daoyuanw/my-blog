      <description>When I was creating my own website, I learned my very first programming language: Markdown&#xD;.&#xA;The link above is an official guidance for markdown, though I haven&amp;rsquo;t read it entirely because I only focused on the questions I &amp;rsquo;ve met or I would have probably. In fact, most of my knowledge learned from the blog of Hongtao Hao&#xD;who was a student majored in journalism and communication then trasfered to computation science.</description>

      <description>Machine Learning is the subfield of the artificial interlligence that give computers the ability to learn without being explicityly programmed.1&#xA;The main types of machine learning are supervised learning and unsupervised learning.&#xA;Supervised Learning Supervised Learning learns from being given “right answers” has been used most widely in real-world applications including spam filtering, speech recoginition, machine translation, online adversising, self-driving cars and visual inspection. The two major algorithms in supervised learning are regression and classification.</description>

      <description>Highlight of Calculus These notes capture the key highlights and concepts from the renowned MIT calculus course taught by Professor Gilbert Strang.&#xA;Overview Calculus deals with the relationships between functions and encompasses both integration and differential calculus. These two types of calculus operate in opposite directions.&#xA;Differential: Suppose we know the distance and time. To determine the speed, we can use differential calculus. Intergration: Integration is in the opposite direction. An example of integration is finding the distance function (function 2) when the speed (function 1) increases at a constant rate.</description>
