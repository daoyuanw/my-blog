I graduated with a Master's degree in Journalism and Communication from [the Journalism and New Media School of Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://xmtxy.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021, advised by Professor [Hongbang Zhang](https://xmtxy.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1223/8549.htm) . From 2021 to 2023, I worked at a state-owned construction company. Now, I am teaching myself computer science and applying for a Ph.D. or a second master’s degree.
