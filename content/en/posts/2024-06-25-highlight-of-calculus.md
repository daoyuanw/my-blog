# Highlight of Calculus

## Overview
**Calculus** deals with the relationships between functions and encompasses both integration and differential calculus. These two types of calculus operate in opposite directions.

- **Differential**: Suppose we know the distance and time. To determine the speed, we can use differential calculus.
- **Intergration:** Integration is in the opposite direction. An example of integration is finding the distance function (function 2) when the speed (function 1) increases at a constant rate. The area of the triangle under the speed-time graph in function 2 is equal to the distance.

This means that, given one of the two functions, you can find the other using calculus.
