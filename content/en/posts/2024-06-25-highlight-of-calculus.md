# Highlight of Calculus
These notes capture the key highlights and concepts from the renowned MIT calculus course taught by Professor Gilbert Strang. I wrote it mainly out of the motivation to active recall the knowledge I've learnt. If it could also help someone to understand the calculus, that would be much greater! 
Faymen said the expert could teach the conception so simple that even a child can understand without problmes. If you find there are something unclear, confusing or mistakes. Please leave me the comment below or contact me via email. 
## Overview
**Calculus** deals with the relationships between functions and encompasses both integration and differential calculus. These two types of calculus operate in opposite directions.

- **Differential**: Suppose we know the distance and time. To determine the speed, we can use differential calculus.
- **Intergration:** Integration is in the opposite direction. An example of integration is finding the distance function (function 2) when the speed (function 1) increases at a constant rate. The area of the triangle under the speed-time graph in function 2 is equal to the distance.

This means that, given one of the two functions, you can find the other using calculus.
