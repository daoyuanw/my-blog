When I was creating my own website, I learned my very first programming language: [Markdown](https://markdown.com.cn/intro.html#markdown-%E6%98%AF%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%EF%BC%9F).

The link Above is an official guidance for markdown, though I haven't read it entirely because I only focused on the questions I 've met or I would have probably. In fact, most of my knowledge learned from [the blog of Hongtao Hao](https://intro2code.hongtaoh.com/markdown#md-grammer) who was a student majored in journalism and communication then trasfered to computation science. It means he knew beginners well so that he wrote the tutorial document in extreme detail.

Except for the basic grammer, I would like to share the solutions of the problems I've met here.
