# Why Jupternotebook?
The first time I exposed to Jupter notebook happens in the Machine Learning Class taught by Andy on Coursea. In the oeprational lab part, learners are required to read or complete the code to implement the concept learned in the class. As a combination of coding, narrative text and visualization, Jupter notebook is an ideal tool for machine learning.
