# Machine Learning from 0 to 1

Machine Learning is the subfield of the artificial interlligence that give computers the ability to learn without being explicityly programmed.^[Authur Samuel,1959].The main types of machine learning are **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**. 

**Supervised Learning** learns from being given “right ansers” has been used most widely in real-world applications including *spam filtering, speech recoginition, machine translation, online adversising, self-driving cars and visual inspection*. The two major algorithms in supervised learning are **regression** and **classification**.

- **Regression** predict a number infinitely many possible outputs, such as inferring the price of a house from a given housing price dataset. The algorithm used here is a typical type of *Linear Regression*. The terminology of the dataset should *trainning set*, where x represents the input variable and y represents the output variable. The term m denotes the number of data rows, and i in parentheses refers to the row of x and y, written as (x<sup>(i)</sup>, y<sup>(i)</sup>)

- **Classification** predict categories and small finite limited numbers.

**Unsupervised Learning** find something interesting in unlabeled data. The data comes with input x, but without labels y. 
- *Clustering* is used to group similar data points like google news.
- *Anomaly detection* is for finding unusual data points like fraud detections.
- *Demensionality reduction* compress data using fewer numbers.
